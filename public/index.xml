      <description>&lt;p&gt;Machine learning systems are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and a critical question emerges: Is the growing complexity of these systems truly justified, or are we building solutions that exceed our cognitive capacity to understand and maintain them?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The concept of &lt;a href=&#34;https://thevaluable.dev/cognitive-load-theory-software-developer/&#34;&gt;cognitive load&lt;/a&gt;, introduced by John Sweller in 1988, suggests that our working memory can only handle a limited amount of information simultaneously. In machine learning and software development, this cognitive load refers to the mental effort required to understand, maintain, and operate systems. As systems grow in complexity, this load increases, potentially leading to reduced efficiency, higher error rates, and increased development time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;welcome-to-my-phd-research-section&#34;&gt;Welcome to My PhD Research Section&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Greetings! This is my PhD journey in Applied Artificial Intelligence, with a keen focus on the critical sub-field of fake news detection. My interest in this area was sparked during my master&amp;rsquo;s studies when I delved into the book &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.es/Social-Physics-Spread-Lessons-Science/dp/1594205655&#34;&gt;Social Physics&lt;/a&gt;. It was at that moment when I realized that fake news detection would become my primary research focus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given the format of my master&amp;rsquo;s thesis ‚Äì structured by publications ‚Äì I am excited to share all my research findings and advancements in this space through this platform.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
