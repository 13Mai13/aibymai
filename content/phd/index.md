# Welcome to My PhD Research Section

Greetings! This is my PhD journey in Applied Artificial Intelligence, with a keen focus on the critical sub-field of fake news detection. My interest in this area was sparked during my master's studies when I delved into the book [Social Physics](https://www.amazon.es/Social-Physics-Spread-Lessons-Science/dp/1594205655). It was at that moment when I realized that fake news detection would become my primary research focus.

Given the format of my master's thesis – structured by publications – I am excited to share all my research findings and advancements in this space through this platform.

My research interests lie deeply in three interconnected domains: Natural Language Processing (NLP), Graph Theory, and Large Language Models (LLMs). These fields offer rich avenues for exploration and innovation, providing powerful tools and techniques to tackle the complex challenges of fake news detection.

I am eager to delve into this multidisciplinary journey, leveraging insights from AI, linguistics, and network science to contribute to the fight against misinformation and promote a more informed and trustworthy information ecosystem.
