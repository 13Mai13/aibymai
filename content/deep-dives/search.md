# Information Retrival

## Why is this topic important? 

In the LLM and AI era it may look a bit odd that search (well, information retrival) is the 1st topic picked to do a deep dive. But is somehow fundamental to the new AI revolution. 

As a machine learning engineer (MLE), the one thing that shocked me most when I first read about RAG (Retrival Augmentend Generation), was that they would have the habilty to make AI systems not be outdated ðŸ¤¯.

I'm aware that there is a lot of nuance to this statement, but thing about it from the prespective of the tradictional machine learning lifecycle: you gather data, preprocess it, train a model, put it in production, the model gets outdated (you need to carefully monitor for this). Now you need to start the cycle again. The promise of RAG is, the retrival will take care of giving the model the right context and the model will still have an good asnwer as long as the context is good. 

There is another angle too. If you've ever worked at an entreprise, one of the issues you'll face as an MLE is the deployment cadence. It depends on the model, but most ML models get outdated or their performance starts to suffer withing weeks (plus you want to accomodate possible traing issues) which forces you to constatly deploy new models. This is very different from the standard software development lifecyle, where in some places you may find code running for + 10 years. 

So, here I was, thinking: would RAG solve all my issues? (spoiler not at all), was search a topic worth to deep dive in? ABSOLUTELY, let's go ðŸ¤¿! 

## What is "search"? 

The field that studies how to give back the most relevat documents given a query is referred to as Information Retrival. Populary known as search because of of browser searchers. There are multiple appraoches to this problem, and sice this is a deep dive well talk a bit about most of them.
