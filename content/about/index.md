# 👩‍💻 About Me

Hi there! I'm Mai. I'm a Staff Software Engineer, with a passion for exploring the fascinating and ever-evolving world of Artificial Intelligence (AI). My journey in AI has been fueled by a deep curiosity about how technology can empower individuals and businesses to solve real-world problems. This blog, "AI by Mai," is my corner of the internet where I unpack the "mysteries" of AI in a casual, approachable way.

Over the years, I’ve worn many hats in the AI space—leading teams, developing machine learning models, and deploying large-scale solutions. I get to apply my expertise to build cutting-edge systems, pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI.

Previously, I worked as a Staff Machine Learning Engineer and Tech Lead, where I led a team building models for attack protection and cybersecurity, as well as contributed to shaping their AI strategy with LLMs (Large Language Models). I’ve also tackled optimization challenges, where my work on machine learning models reduced customer churn and optimized routes, creating measurable impact.

# 💡 Why This Blog?

"AI by Mai" is for anyone curious about how AI and software enginner and how they get along togeather. Some of the topics I'll cover are: 

* Informal insights on AI concepts, research, and trends.

* Practical advice on making AI accessible and impactful in everyday scenarios.

* Explorations of topics I love, like graph-based algorithms, LLM's and Optimization Algorithms.

* Hands on projects exploring different programing langues, algorithms and trends


# 🚀 Beyond AI

When I’m not coding or mentoring, you’ll find me exploring open-source projects, reading, or just enjoying the simpler joys of life. 

The main hobbie I have for this year is surfing 🏄‍♀️! Where I'm trying to get better every day

Let’s keep it simple, authentic, and fun. Whether you’re an AI enthusiast, a fellow engineer, or just AI-curious, I hope this blog inspires you to dig deeper into the world of AI.

Stay tuned, and let’s explore this AI journey together!
