# 👩‍💻 About Me

Hi! I'm Mai, a Staff Software Engineer passionate about AI. At "AI by Mai," I break down complex AI concepts in a casual, approachable way. I've led teams developing machine learning models for cybersecurity, industrial predictive control systems, and marketplace optimization. My work spans from LLMs to real-time system optimization, focusing on practical applications that create real impact.

# 💡 What I Write About

* AI concepts and trends in plain language

* Software engineering best practices

* Hands-on projects with various programming languages

* Deep dives: graph algorithms, LLMs, search, optimization or any other topic I may find interesting

# 🚀 Beyond Tech

When not coding, I explore open-source projects and am currently learning to surf 🏄‍♀️! I've also been working in my pijamas since 2020 😆

Let's explore AI together!
