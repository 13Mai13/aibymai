This week I read (TWIR) starts as a personal project of this new year. The goal is simple but ambitious (as an MVP or POC of a bigger project). I'll post every week about what I've read and why I believe it's important. Let's start: 

This week since I was doing my quarterly review I've read, but specially listened, a lot about career:

- [Why I Ignore The Spotlight as a Staff Engineer]([https://lalitm.com/software-engineering-outside-the-spotlight/?&aid=recc4XcNf5fDELM89&_bhlid=3416a3eb746bbd6a15e022c2ad8ddd60d97799ad](https://lalitm.com/software-engineering-outside-the-spotlight/?&aid=recc4XcNf5fDELM89&_bhlid=3416a3eb746bbd6a15e022c2ad8ddd60d97799ad)) Liked it because it talks about career progression from an infrastructure standpoint, less feature driven and more solid and sustainable. 

-  [Boris Cherny's interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmdLVWMdjOk) I really liked his curiousity, and how he wants to work with people who go a layer deeper. He claims to "use common sense". The fun part is that way of thinking isn't common at all. The contact with code as a programmer and the idea of believing in the mission of what you are working on really stood out to me. He also claims the no title approach and how trust needs to be earned in every room. 

-  [Ryan Peterman's best of 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCBoxmqijic) He's got a whole podcast on career stories and advice from top niche people. However from the words of these people the one thing I see is how they deal with burning out: cultivating relationships, understanding there is life outside work, using common sense and doing the right thing. These are my key takeouts. 

PS: I'm writing this with my first ever split keyboard, insanely slowly.
