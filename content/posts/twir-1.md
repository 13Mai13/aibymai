This week I read (TWIR) starts as a personal project of this new year. The goal is simple but ambitious (as an MVP or POC of a bigger project). I'll post every week about the what've read and why I believe is important. Let's start: 

This week since I was doing my quarterly review I've read, but specially listend, a lot about carrer:

- [Why I Ignore The Spotlight as a Staff Engineer]([https://lalitm.com/software-engineering-outside-the-spotlight/?&aid=recc4XcNf5fDELM89&_bhlid=3416a3eb746bbd6a15e022c2ad8ddd60d97799ad](https://lalitm.com/software-engineering-outside-the-spotlight/?&aid=recc4XcNf5fDELM89&_bhlid=3416a3eb746bbd6a15e022c2ad8ddd60d97799ad)) Liked it because it talks about career progresion from an infrastructure standpoint, less feature driven and more solid and sustinable. 

-  [Boris Cherny's interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmdLVWMdjOk) I really liked how courious of a person he is, and how he wants to work with equally courios people who go a layer deep. He claims to "use common sense" the fun part is, that way of thinking isn't common at all. The contact with code as a programmer and the idea of beliveing in the misson of what you are working on really stood out to me. He also claims the no title approach and how trust needs to be earned in every room. 

-  [Ryan Peterman's best of 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCBoxmqijic) He's got a whole podcast on career stories and advice from top nieche people. However from the words of this people the one thing I see is how they deal with burning out: cultivating relationships, understanding there is life outside work, using common sense and doing the right thing, are my key takeouts. 

PS: I'm writting this with my first ever split keyboard, insanely slowly.
