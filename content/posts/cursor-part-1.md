The name is `thoughts on Cursor` but it could evolve to `thoughts in any AI assintat for coding`. If you are expecting a fierce critique to the tool, this is not your place, I definively don't like to do repetitve work and I see this tools as an IDEAL way to work I don't like doing for ME. However, among the software developers that are on the "We should use AI for coding team" I see lot's of unrealistic expectations and claims that are at the same time contradicting and irrealistic. 

## Claims

This post is triggered by two main claims, the first one was passed to me by my father (who is not into programming or AI) and the second one was told to me a month ago by someone in a senior leadership role in engineering. 

* [**NVIDIA CEO says the future of coding as a career might already be dead in the water with the imminent prevalence of AI**](https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/nvidia-ceo-says-the-future-of-coding-as-a-career-might-already-be-dead)

* **This tools will allow every engineer to be a 10x engineer** 


There are other articles of course, with another view about AI, is not that the public opinion has belived that and that's it, but a debate was opened, and is reflected in several internet forumns like Reddit or Medium. 

But the goal of this article is to refect a bit on why do I still support AI based tools for programing and also reflect a bit deeper on what is the value of an engineer. 

## Okay, why aren't you afraid of loosing your job then? 

I'm not. Or not today. Maybe I should be (who knows if my manager reads this blog and deeply dislikes it ;). Jokes aside, I'm not, and if I were I don't think it would be because of AI.

Any tech company, is trying to solve a **business problem** **through tech** for customer who are willing to pay for that **service** or **product**. This statement is broad and generic, but it kind of  

Let's analize what is the value proposion of an engineering department in that **business**.
