The name is `thoughts on Cursor` but it could evolve to `thoughts in any AI assintat for coding`. If you are expecting a fierce critique to the tool, this is not your place, I definively don't like to do repetitve work and I see this tools as an IDEAL way to work I don't like doing for ME. However, among the software developers that are on the "We should use AI for coding team" I see lot's of unrealistic expectations and claims that are at the same time contradicting and irrealistic. 

## Claims

This post is triggered by two main claims, the first one was passed to me by my father (who is not into programming or AI) and the second one was told to me a month ago by someone in a senior leadership role in engineering. 

* [**NVIDIA CEO says the future of coding as a career might already be dead in the water with the imminent prevalence of AI**](https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/nvidia-ceo-says-the-future-of-coding-as-a-career-might-already-be-dead)

* **This tools will allow every engineer to be a 10x engineer** 


There are other articles of course, with another view about AI, is not that the public opinion has belived that and that's it, but a debate was opened, and is reflected in several internet forumns like Reddit or Medium. 

But the goal of this article is to refect a bit on why do I still support AI based tools for programing and also reflect a bit deeper on what is the value of an engineer. 

## Okay, why aren't you afraid of loosing your job then? 

I'm not. Or not today. Maybe I should be (who knows if my manager reads this blog and deeply dislikes it ;). Jokes aside, I'm not, and if I were I don't think it would be because of AI.

Any tech company, is trying to solve a **business problem** **through tech** for customer who are willing to pay for that **service** or **product**. This statement is broad and generic, but it kind of  

Let's analize what is the value proposion of an engineering department in that **business**. The goal of engineering would be to create and maintain a product that solved that business need and satifies those expectations. 

Here the trick is **satifies custumer expectations**. Can I ask cursor to create an app for me - Yes. Will I know what is going on in that app if a customer is complaining about it crashing - Probably not. Is that **what the customer expects** - I guess it depends, but I'm pretty certain that my manager won't be happy about it. 

### What do they pay you for? 

### What do they not pay for? 

I personally **REALLY** hope AI can help me here. Is the type of task where I provide 0 value but due to regulation, nature of the works or others I need to do. 

Before going deeper into this topic, I want to clarify that there is a **Clear** Tradeoff done here: *I'm aware I'm not learning how to do this task, but becasue I'm not interested in doing so (I think I'll only do it once, I need to do it fast,  or other reasons) I opt for AI to do it for me*

If this was a matrix it would be like this:

## What does using cursor feel like? 

### Should everyone be able to code? 

My answer is YES. At least everyone who is interested. My main coding languge is python, and the thing I like about it the most is how **easy to read** and **flexible** it is. 

Not everything you do with coding with coding requires to be an enterprise software, I use it to track some of my expenses for example. Plain script againts test sheet. It automates stuff I need to do, it works. I probably spend less than 20mins generating that scrip that is runned by weekly, about a year ago. The task took me like 5 mins. Simple formula: 

```
5 mins * 2 per week * 52 weeks a year = 520 mins a year ~ 8.5 h
```

Investing 20 mins to safe 8.6 h, makes sense to me. Would it make sense if my bank offered that funcitionality, no! And I wish they did, so I wouldn't need to support it!  

So, on the same way I'm not a professional accountant, but I know the basics about my taxes. Profesional developers shoudn't be afraid of practitioners playing around with AI to generate code for their specific needs.
