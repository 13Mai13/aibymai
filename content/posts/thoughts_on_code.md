For those who don't know me I grew up in a very small village, actually in a quite far away (for european distances) neighborhood of a very small village. This means that in the best case scenario you had betwen 50 - 80 people of all ages living around you. As every underepresented space (in this case with the townhall) there were many challenges that we needed to face togeather (street light outages, floods, and many more) of course becase it was far and many old people used to live there, new people started to come to our negihborhood, and I rembeer that all the neighborts were worried about one single thing: *would they be "good citizens"* 

This anectdote ilustrated very well what good coding practices is the "good citizenship" of code. 

# Are good coding practices still relevat? 

## What about AI? 

I have no doubt that AI is and will be shaping the way we write code. And that's fine IMO. Is one more tool to enhance productity. However it you look at why the practices are important, AI won't do them for you.
