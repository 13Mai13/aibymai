Learning is a key part of any career path, even more if you work in tech due to the massive amount of new technologies that arise every single month. When it comes to Machine Learning and AI, well, I don't even need to repeat it after how exiciting this new year looks after ONE SINGLE MONTH ðŸ˜±

But learning, specially with the fast peace of tech industries, can definitively feel overwhelming. This is why this is the first of three posts about learning that will be based on the: [Why, What, How framework](https://simonsinek.com/product/golden-circle-for-individuals/)

# Why should you learn? 

Most people would answer to this with: *because is good for your career* but I've never found that answer to be very motivational plus is only "work realted", and there is much more out there. In my opinion not learning is somehow to give up. There are two angles to this: Personal and profesional one. 

## Learning is an attitude

One can argue that learning is an attitude to face life. If one looks to the scientific method, is all about learning. Make a hypotheis, create a experiment to validate this hypotesis, was the result expected? Yes -> great we know why, no, do we need to chanfe the the hypotheis or the experiment and keep in this loop. (MIRAR ESTO BIEN)

The reality is that you'll need to face many unexpected unmangeble situation sin your lifetimeg and learning will be the key thing that will let you overcome those.
